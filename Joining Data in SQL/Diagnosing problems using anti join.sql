Begin by writing a query to return the code and name (in order, not aliased) for all countries in the continent of Oceania from the countries table.
Observe the number of records returned and compare this with the provided INNER JOIN, which returns 15 records.
Now, build on your query to complete your anti join, by adding an additional filter to return every country code that is not included in the currencies table. */
